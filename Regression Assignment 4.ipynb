    "Lasso regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a type of linear regression that can be used to select a subset of the most important features in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by adding a penalty term to the regression equation that encourages small coefficients or weights for the input features. This penalty term is\n",
    "proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, which means that some of the coefficients can be reduced to zero if the penalty is high enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques, such as ridge regression or ordinary least squares regression, lasso regression has the advantage of being able to \n",
    "perform feature selection. Ridge regression, for example, also adds a penalty term to the regression equation, but it is proportional to the square of the\n",
    "coefficients instead of the absolute value. This means that ridge regression tends to shrink all coefficients towards zero, but it rarely eliminates any of them \n",
    "entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between lasso regression and other regression techniques is that the penalty term in lasso regression can lead to a sparser solution. This is\n",
    "because the penalty term can force some of the coefficients to be exactly equal to zero, which means that the corresponding input features are completely ignored \n",
    "in the regression equation. This can be useful for reducing overfitting and improving the interpretability of the model.\n",

    "The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model can be interpreted in a similar way as the coefficients of a linear regression model. However, because Lasso \n",
    "Regression can set some coefficients to zero, the interpretation of the remaining coefficients can be slightly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the sign of the coefficient indicates the direction and strength of the relationship between the corresponding input feature and the target variable. A \n",
    "positive coefficient means that the feature has a positive effect on the target variable, while a negative coefficient means that the feature has a negative effect.\n",
    "The magnitude of the coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship, with larger magnitudes indicating stronger effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the presence of a non-zero coefficient indicates that the corresponding input feature is important for predicting the target variable. If a coefficient is\n",
    "exactly zero, it means that the corresponding feature has been excluded from the model and is not relevant for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model can be affected by the scaling of the input features. Therefore, it is often a good idea\n",
    "to normalize or standardize the input features before fitting a Lasso Regression model, so that the coefficients can be compared more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model involves looking at the sign and magnitude of each coefficient, as well as whether it is \n",
